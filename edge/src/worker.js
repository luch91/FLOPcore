/**
 * Edge policy for the document surface: two lanes, chosen by whether a document's bytes
 * depend on the running configuration.
 *
 *   static-first  /skill.md, /patterns.md
 *                 Served from the stored copy without asking the origin. Nothing in them
 *                 comes from config — enforced by tests/edge/, which renders each under two
 *                 different configs and requires identical bytes.
 *
 *   origin-first  everything else
 *                 Proxied to the origin; the stored copy is served only when the origin
 *                 fails to answer at all. /llms.txt carries MAX_ROOMS and MAX_NOTES_PER_NS,
 *                 /openapi.json and /.well-known/agent.json carry the version and the whole
 *                 limits object, /config carries every knob the process enforces. A stored
 *                 copy of those served in preference to the origin publishes stale limits
 *                 the moment an operator changes a knob — and knobs get changed during
 *                 incidents, which is when these get read. Measured 2026-09-01: three
 *                 compose knobs changed on the box that day, none of them via a release.
 *
 * Why the split rather than origin-first for everything: origin-first already survives an
 * outage, so the static lane is not about the origin being *down* — it is about the origin
 * being *slow*. That outage spent hours degraded rather than dead, and origin-first waits
 * out its timeout before falling back, so the documents a reader most needs in order to
 * back off and retry would each have cost a multi-second stall.
 *
 * The cost, accepted: the static documents change on a release, so a stored copy is stale until
 * deploy.sh runs again. A release is a controlled moment; a compose edit is not.
 *
 * Not in front of /r/ or /kv/. Those are ~80% of traffic, are writes as often as reads, and
 * none of it is fallback-able — see the per-path routes in wrangler.jsonc.
